<h2>Scatter plot of data points - scatter.py </h2>

<p>Display a scatter plot using two columns from a Spider document file as the X and Y axes.</p>

<p>Usage: <b><code>scatter.py docfile [x y]</code></b></p>

<p>where <i>x,y</i> specify which SPIDER docfile columns to plot. 
   (1 = first data column, 0 = keys)</p>

<p>Each plotted point is associated with a <i>key</i> number from the doc file. 
   This key number is used to specifiy a file number in the Unix command that 
   is invoked when a point is double clicked.</p>

<p><h3>Modes</h3></p>

<p>There are three modes of operation that affect the mouse cursor:</p>

<ol>
  <p>
  <li><b>Normal</b> : as the mouse cursor is moved over points, the 
      corresponding key is displayed in the <i>key</i> box, as well as substituted 
      into the <i>Unix command</i> text string. If a point is double clicked, 
      the Unix command is executed. <br/><br/>

      For example, if each point corresponds to an image, you can display the image 
      by in the qview program clicking on its point if the Unix command is 
      <code>qview.py img001.dat</code>. xv or some other display program will also work, 
      as long as the Unix command is legal. If each point corresponds to a class, then you 
      could use the command <code>classavg.py class001.dat</code>.<br/><br/>

      If any polygons have been drawn around points, the currently selected polygon is 
      shown in yellow, the others are blue. Polygons are selected by clicking on their outlines.
  </li>
  </p>

  <p>
  <li> <b>Magnifier</b> : the <i>Magnifier</i> button at the top is green when in this mode. 
      In Magnifier mode, use the left mouse button to select a rectangle - the screen zooms 
      in on this area. Reset the view under <b>Options</b> - <i>Reset view</i>. 
      Magnifier mode is toggled on/off by clicking the Magnifier button.
  </li>
  </p>

  <p>
  <li><b>Region select</b> : the <i>Region select</i> button at the top is green 
      when in this mode. In this mode, you can outline a polygon with the left 
      mouse button, finishing the polygon with right mouse button. The left mouse 
      button will continue to draw polygons until Region select mode is turned off 
      by clicking the Region select button.
  </li>
  </p>
</ol>
