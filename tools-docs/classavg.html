<h2>View a montage of class averages - classavg.py</h2>

<p> View a montage of class averages. Click on an average to bring up a montage of images in that class.</p>

<p> <b>Usage: classavg.py classimg*</b>           <br />
  where classimg* are the class average images</p>

<p> There are three file types used by classavg.py:</p>

<ol> 
  <p>
  <li>Average images : SPIDER images of the class averages. Each has an associated doc file 
      with the same number. The doc file lists the image numbers that belong to this class.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
  <li> SPIDER document files, one for each class average, the first column has particle 
       numbers. A <i>Doc file template</i> is used to specify doc files. </li>
  </p>

  <p>
  <li> Particle images : specified by a <i>Particle template</i>.</li>
  </p>

</ol>

<p>
  For the templates, you can click on the label "Doc file template" to browse for a file. 
  Numbers in the filename will be replaced by asterisks.</p>

<p> <center><img src="pics/classavg.gif"></center></p>

<p>
  For example, after running the SPIDER procedure  
  <a href="../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html#CA ">average.bat</a>, 
  you can view a montage of averages with:
</p>

<p> <code>classavg.py avg/avg*</code></p>

<p>
  Clicking on an image brings up the template browser. Click on the button that says 
  "Doc file template", use the browser to select one of the <b>df00N/select/sel001.ext</b> 
  files, where <b>df00N</b> is the defocus group corresponding 
  to the average images. It doesn't matter which select file you pick - it's only getting
  the filename pattern.<br />
  For "Particle template", you can cut and paste in "<b>../Particles/win/ser******.ext</b>" 
  or "../Particles/<b>flt</b>/ser******.ext". (If you have thousands of files in a directory, 
  use the browser at own risk!)
