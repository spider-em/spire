<p><b>Getting started:</b></p>

<p> The inputs for this program are primarily from 
<a href="../../docs/techs/recon1/Procs/verify-class-byview.spi">verify-class-byview.spi</a> 
  -- a list of classes, class-average images, and class-to-particle look-up 
  tables -- plus filtered images. </p>


<p> If your image files are on remote computers, I'd suggest at least 
checking if network transfer is the limiting step. To do so, you'd have 
to xhost that remote computer and set the environment. Jamie LeBarron 
reminded me how to do this: </p>

<pre>
on computer you are in front of:  xhost +FarAwayComputerName
on terminal of FarAwayComputer:   setenv DISPLAY BoxInFrontOfMeName:0
</pre>

<p> For the purpose of illustration below, assume I will be running the 
program from the reconstruction: <b>Averages</b> directory. </p>

<hr />

<p><b>Procedure:</b></p>

<p> Assuming the python source file is in your <i>$PATH</i>, one would run it by typing:  </p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp; <b> verifybyview  &amp; </b>

<p> If you're running it for the first time, there will be some pre-set 
defaults, e.g., that the document files (input and output) are in the 
directory <b>views/prj001</b>, and that the class list is called <b>listclasses.dat</b>. 
An initial settings window will open: </p>

<center><p align="center"><img src="pics/gui-initial.gif"></p></center>

<p> If your data extension is not <b>.dat</b>, be sure to change it here. 
The rest of the defaults should be consistent with the batch files. If 
you need to change them, you can use the text field or click on the 
buttons at the left to navigate the directories.  </p>

<p>  Alternatively you could, at startup, include a directory as an argument (the 
rationale for this argument is that directory navigation can be slow):     </p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>verifybyview  &nbsp;views/prj001 &amp; </b>

<p>or alternatively with the class-list document as an argument:</p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>verifybyview  &nbsp;views/prj001/listclasses.dat &amp; </b>

<p>Now, a montage of class-averages will pop up.</p>

<center><p align="center"><img src="pics/gui-ve0829.gif"></p></center>

<p>  When you click on a class-average for the first time, there will be a 
pop-up window asking for inputs and outputs.                </p>

<center><p align="center"><img src="pics/gui-templates.gif"></p></center>

<p> The first two you will have entered by now. The rest are new, but in 
general I've set the default names such that you shouldn't need to 
change them. (For subsequent class-montages, this template box will not 
appear.) Now, the montage of individual particles will appear.  </p>

<center><p align="center"><img src="pics/gui-mn14.gif"></p></center>

<p> This part should be intuitive. Sometimes, clicking on the bad particles 
and inverting the selection is easier. Shift-clicking will select the 
contiguous stretch of particles from the last one you selected. SHIFT 
will &quot;paint&quot; a selection series (when you enter a new image, 
not the current one).   </p>

<p> There are some keyboard shortcuts here (also available in <b>Help -&gt; 
Keyboard shortcuts</b>):               </p>

<ul>
    <li>CTRL-a == Select all </li>
    <li>CTRL-v == Invert selection </li>
    <li>DEL    == Clear all</li>
    <li>CTRL-s == Save to good-particle list </li>
    <li>CTRL-r == Read existing good-particle list </li>
    <li>CTRL-w == Close window </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, save the good-particle list and close the window. </p>

<p> After you close the particle-montage window, the color of the 
background for the class-average will change: green if you kept 
particles, or red if you kept none. Your console window will say how 
many particles you saved from a particular class. So if you're not sure 
if you saved it, check there.    </p>

<p>A final series of class-averages might look like the following:</p>

<center><p align="CENTER"><img src="pics/gui-ve0829b.gif"></p></center>

<p>  It isn't necessary to click on all of the averages. For example, I'm 
fairly sure <b>classavg008</b> won't have many good particles.   </p>

<p> You can save your list of goodclasses with <b>File -&gt; Save selection</b>. 
If you're going to be changing to a different directory (i.e., 
different reference-view), just change the path in the directory-field 
and click on the <b>Save+Update</b> button. Lather, rinse, repeat.  </p>

<p> If you forget to save the list of good classes one or more times, 
there is a batch file in the <b>VerifyMisc/</b> directory called <b>byhand2goodclasses.spi</b> 
which will generate them from the <b>byhand***</b> files 
that are created when you save a class.  </p>

<p> There are some keyboard shortcuts here also (as above, shown in <b>Help 
-&gt; Keyboard shortcuts</b>). The class-average window uses 'ALT' 
instead of 'CTRL' for shortcuts, in case you're confused as to which 
window you're in.  </p>

<ul>
    <li>ALT-u  == Update directory                       </li>
    <li>ALT-r  == Read existing good-class list          </li>
    <li>ALT-l  == Locate pre-existing good-particle lists</li>
    <li>ALT-s  == Save to good-class list                </li>
    <li>ALT-F4 == Close everything                      </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Development Rationale:</b></p>

<p> The three modes of particle-verification ('classes only', 'first good', 
'by hand') were an attempt to offer various degrees of control over 
which particles we kept. As things stood, using WEB, each additional 
layer of control adds quite a bit more complexity. Intrinsically, 
better quality control implies more intervention, but my goal was to 
minimize the extra intervention. To that end, I wrote a graphical 
interface specifically for the classification-based 
particle-verification routine. These Python scripts weren't written 
from scratch, but rather adapted from the SPIRE accessories: 
<ul>
    <li><a href="classavg.html">classavg.py</a></li>
    <li><a href="montage.html">montage.py</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p> What I wanted classavg.py to do was to be able to select classes and 
write output. In contrast, I didn't need to change montage.py very 
much, except adding features, as noted below. </p>
